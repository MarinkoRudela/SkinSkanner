1. Facial Analysis:
   - Fine lines and wrinkles
   - Volume loss and facial contours
   - Skin texture and tone
   - Pigmentation or discoloration
   - Pore size and appearance
   - Signs of aging
   - Skin laxity
   - Under-eye concerns

Your response must be formatted as a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
  "primary_concerns": ["Major concern 1", "Major concern 2", "Major concern 3"],
  "primary_recommendations": ["Primary treatment 1", "Primary treatment 2", "Primary treatment 3"],
  "secondary_concerns": ["Minor concern 1", "Minor concern 2", "Minor concern 3"],
  "secondary_recommendations": ["Secondary treatment 1", "Secondary treatment 2", "Secondary treatment 3"]
}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Provide exactly 3 primary and 3 secondary observations with matching treatment recommendations
${treatments ? '- Only recommend treatments from the provided list of available treatments' : '- Provide general treatment recommendations'}
- Each concern must be paired with its corresponding treatment recommendation in the same array position
- Primary concerns should focus on the most noticeable or urgent treatment needs
- Secondary concerns should address enhancement opportunities or preventive care
- Tailor language and recommendations to match the expertise level of a ${businessTitle}`;
