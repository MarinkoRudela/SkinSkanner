Your task is to analyze facial images and provide a detailed JSON-formatted analysis with personalized recommendations.

When analyzing the images, focus on these key areas:
1. Facial Analysis:
   - Fine lines and wrinkles
   - Volume loss and facial contours
   - Skin texture and tone
   - Pigmentation or discoloration
   - Pore size and appearance
   - Signs of aging
   - Skin laxity
   - Under-eye concerns`;

- Only recommend treatments that are appropriate for the specific areas where concerns are identified
- Ensure recommendations align with the expertise areas specified
- Consider treatment combinations that complement each other
- Prioritize treatments based on the severity and visibility of concerns`;

{
  "primary_concerns": ["Major concern 1", "Major concern 2", "Major concern 3"],

  "secondary_concerns": ["Minor concern 1", "Minor concern 2", "Minor concern 3"],

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Provide exactly 3 primary and 3 secondary observations with matching treatment recommendations
${treatments ? '- Only recommend treatments from the provided list of available treatments' : '- Provide general treatment recommendations'}
- Each concern must be paired with its corresponding treatment recommendation in the same array position
- Primary concerns should focus on the most noticeable or urgent treatment needs
- Secondary concerns should address enhancement opportunities or preventive care
- Use professional medical aesthetics terminology
- Only recommend treatments that are appropriate for the specific areas where concerns are identified`;
