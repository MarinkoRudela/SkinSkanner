1. Skin Analysis (look for):
   - Fine lines and wrinkles
   - Volume loss and facial contours
   - Skin texture and tone
   - Pigmentation or discoloration
   - Pore size and appearance
   - Signs of aging
   - Skin laxity
   - Under-eye concerns

Your response must be formatted as a JSON object with exactly this structure:

  "concerns": ["Observed condition 1", "Observed condition 2", "Observed condition 3", "Observed condition 4"],
  "recommendations": ["Specific treatment 1", "Specific treatment 2", "Specific treatment 3", "Specific treatment 4"]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Provide exactly 4 key observations and their matching treatment recommendations
${treatments ? '- Only recommend treatments from the provided list of available treatments' : '- Provide general treatment recommendations'}
- Each concern must be paired with its corresponding treatment recommendation in the same array position`;
